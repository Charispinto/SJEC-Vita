## Problem Statement
In the banking industry, understanding how users will react to new mobile app features is crucial for successful product launches.
Poorly planned features can lead to **significant losses** and damage to not just the company but also the existing user base.
**Metrics** such as user interactions and preferences help gauge feature requirements.
However, relying exclusively on demographic data for adoption analysis is **limiting and ineffective**.
The most strategic approach begins with a universal touchpoint—**direct user feedback**—to drive meaningful improvements.
