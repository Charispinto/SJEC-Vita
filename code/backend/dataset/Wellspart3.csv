Some suggestions for the app - incorporating pictures of bank cards (debit and credit) within the app would be a neat visual; being able to rearrange your accounts within the app (like Chase and Capital One) would be awesome; and maybe some trivia in the app would be nice, including historical trivia about Wells Fargo bank, being one of the oldest banks around (US).

The other drawback is the monthly limit for mobile check deposit too low. I have have paychecks once every two weeks, I have to deposit my second check to my other bank account due to the limit.

88,88,2020-04-09 04:08:38,,"First off, the Wells Fargo app is overall good and does almost everything I need. There is efficient online banking for savings, checking, and brokerage accounts and simple transferring of money between these accounts. Credit card awards (Go Far Rewards) are simple to redeem. The user interface is overall good. 

The reason why it gets 4 stars is a few things that Wells Fargo should address: 

1) Lack of push notifications for the American Express Propel Credit Card. For some unknown reason they don‚Äôt allow the option for push notifications alerts with this credit card and it makes no sense. This should be simple to implement because they have push notification alerts on their debit cards. I‚Äôve spoken with Wells Fargo about this multiple times both on the phone and through their twitter account without success.

2) Display the amount of reward points earned with each credit card transaction. The Chase app and American Express App do this. Sometimes it‚Äôs not clear what category a merchant falls under and it‚Äôs helpful to see how many points each transaction earned you.

3) Polish and clean up the brokerage side of the app. Stock trading and monitoring real time stock changes through the app is slow and feels outdated, especially after using an app like robinhood.

the reason why it gets 4 stars is a few things that wells fargo should address 

1 lack of push notifications for the american express propel credit card for some unknown reason they dont allow the option for push notifications alerts with this credit card and it makes no sense this should be simple to implement because they have push notification alerts on their debit cards ive spoken with wells fargo about this multiple times both on the phone and through their twitter account without success

and next time you change the app and request feedback give more time to really use it first i didnt give feedback when it was offered bc i hadnt had time to really use it too much but just when i figured out what had changed the feedback response was removed 
i really need help in finding some things that were messed up in my account but i am experiencing so much difficulty finding them 
and it doesnt go back far enough are we now expected to just disregard our old statements i never printed them bc i knew thought i knew i could look them up anytime
