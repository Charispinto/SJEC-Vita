Some suggestions for the app - incorporating pictures of bank cards (debit and credit) within the app would be a neat visual; being able to rearrange your accounts within the app (like Chase and Capital One) would be awesome; and maybe some trivia in the app would be nice, including historical trivia about Wells Fargo bank, being one of the oldest banks around (US).

Yet their app has really only been good for basic functions such as checking balances or making simple deposits, withdrawals, or payments. The app itself has always lacked an intuitive interface. It‚Äôs always been confusing finding several functions, or straight up lacking, like searching for old transactions. It took them years for you to simply view your bank statements other than logging in on a desktop or even viewing your own account numbers or routing numbers. 

The biggest glaring, missing feature is a useful budgeting/spending tool. Recently a monthly spending report has been added, albeit within layers of unclear tabs and options. This spending report is pretty useless. I‚Äôm guessing it categorizes transactions based on the institution classification that the charge went to, and then shows an overall amount spent on that category. It doesn‚Äôt show you the transactions in question so you don‚Äôt know what you spent on which could help in managing your spending in the future. Bank of America has a great budget/spending tool that clearly shows what you‚Äôve spent on and not just dumping everything into general categories.

So, although they have excelled in their online presence for their customers, their chain stores/branches, have lacked the proper customer service since 2020. Which brings me to my next point. After the 2008 Crash, Wells Fargo Bank tried to recuperate itself and its constituents and associates to reinstitute itself as a leading lender, banker and financial distributor to the public. Unfortunately, the persoanl customer service in branch has depleted and is very hard to get an appointment to speak to any banker or even manager for that matter. It‚Äôs difficult to conduct proper business banking protocols without having that freedom to speak to a human being at any given time during working hours.

Tomorrow I will need to go to ATM or bank to do the deposit, that defeats the purpose of mobile deposits.

The other drawback is the monthly limit for mobile check deposit too low. I have have paychecks once every two weeks, I have to deposit my second check to my other bank account due to the limit.

It is very difficult to even navigate to the best area to check what little analytics they provide, but when you get there it‚Äôs hard to find anything of significant value. The total invested versus the total value of the portfolio which tells you whether your assets have an overall positive or negative change in value only updates at the end of each calendar month. JUST ONCE A MONTH. That is so crazy. There is room for very significant improvement as far as the investment portfolio UI and data associated with it goes, and that is the reason for my low rating.

After talking to them and going through the steps to reset my account once again they asked me to try to log on. I was unable to.

WF app, same as online, allows you to set debit and credit card alerts for as low as $1 charge. And to turn your card off if it‚Äôs lost/stolen. Also, the ability to generate a PIN to use at the ATM without the card is a great feature. Increase to the check deposit amount using the app would be a welcome addition. 

I‚Äôve never had issues using the Touch ID; however, it is somewhat of an adjustment losing that feature after upgrade to the iPhone XS. I love that WF was quick to update the app to include facial recognition. 

My experience with Zelle is +/-. I pine for the prior method of send/receive. Able to transfer to an outside business bank account I have with no issue.

To me it seems that the default would be whichever accounts are being viewed. 

Also, before photographing a check for mobile deposit, I would like to see the text ‚Äúfor mobile deposit at wells fargo bank inly‚Äù that needs to be included with the signature on the back of the check before beginning to take photos. It doesn‚Äôt appear until the back of the check is to be photographed, and there isn‚Äôt enough time to add that text before the app gives up trying to take the photo of the back of the check.

Forget the ATM withdraw feature too. Not only is it useless without your ATM card, branch employees aren't able to walk you through the process. If you forget your debit card it will likely take less time to pick it up from home or vehicle than to attempt this ""feature.""

Each time that I was promised a replacement card, overnight, I spent hours on the phone: and, no overnight Card was shipped, as promised.  

Additionally, I was instructed that I could set up Wells Fargo online banking services, and the following ATM locations failed to accept my online Wells Fargo Bank Card, as their card-reader was temporarily defunct: 1. Harrison, New York  2. Larchmont, New York  3. Yonkers, New York.  

To date, my Bank Card has not been received, and the Supervisor out of Forthworth, Texas, Ms. Nicole Gatlin, stated that there is nothing she can do, and no additional supervisor that I could speak to, about this urgent issue.  

Unfortunately, my bill will be paid late, and I will incur unnecessary late fees.  This situation could have been avoided if Wells Fargo‚Äôs agents fulfilled their overnight obligation.

Let me repeat: Limits on mobile deposits are idiotic. 

They are idiotic and an insult. 

Wells Far Go will not go far if it is constantly ripping off people, 
lying to their customers, 
and inconveniencing them with: 

limits on mobile deposits- which are idiotic. 

The only reason I use the stupid app is to mobile deposit- and I burn through my limit in 5 minutes. Gee that's convenient! And so thoughtful of you Well Ripoff.  I don't feel inconvenienced at all, I'll just jump in my car, take time away from my work and drive to your location where you expect ME to enter it all in for you in your ""automatic teller"". 

What an insult you are to the human race. I'm done with you.
