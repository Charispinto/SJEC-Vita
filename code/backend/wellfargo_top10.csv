That is my only use for this app. Wells Fargo won't even let the app open without giving it a LONG list of permissions. You don't need access to my mic, or contacts, or location in background. You don't need to scan and connect to nearby devices or see other apps currently open. However, if a single one from their list isn't allowed the app refuses to open. I'm deleting this app and you should too.",1,55,7.0.80,2023-02-02 19:14:46,"Hi, we constantly strive to provide our customers with a great experience.

However, its camera feature is broken in that it displays the image upsidedown. This makes it very difficult and frustrating to frame receipts in the photo. I don't think the app is utilizing the camera API properly. There's also no way of uploading PDF receipts.",2,47,2.11.2,2017-11-12 22:36:44,,,2.11.2

The Biometric option used to work, one day it just stopped and it will not move past the screen to select it to set up when you try.  Also uploading images used to work great, now it just freezes up.  You should just do what everyone else does and allow thumbprint to sign in.  There's also 0 reason you need location permissions for this app. --- Edit after reply from developer: Months ago I emailed you guys about this problem and you were no help in resolving.  This is a business application.  It needs to work.  Obviously from the comments, I'm not the only person having the issues.",1,46,3.9.0,2019-05-08 13:32:36,Thanks for the update.

App was updated 12-01-20. App now freezing. By far the worst part of the app is that it makes your phone vibrate while taking a picture of a receipt, causing the image to be blurry, which is a hilariously poor feature. Can just see the WF group telling the app developers, ""make it vibrate when it takes the photo, it'll definitely give the user a better experience!"" Lots to fix. Could easily add a setting to shut vibration off.",1,34,4.1.0,2021-01-06 22:16:02,"Hi, we constantly strive to provide our customers with a great experience.

The sign-in might be the least worst part, when I remember my password (the app doesnt let you see the pw you enter, so dont mess up). After three failed attempts you are locked out and have to call an 800 number like it is the 1990s. One you are in the app, things slow way down. I'm not exaggerating when I say it may take 2-3 seconds from screen press to action.

The updated app works exactly like the browser version. BUT on an Android cellphone where screen space is at a premium, the app elements cannot be re-sized. When you need to use the keyboard, #1, the keyboard pops up and covers the data entry box - you type blind. #2, on my phone you type normally (& blindly) ""Printing"" and when you get to see your words, they are entered backwards!

Most apps allow you to deny permissions, then when the app actually needs to access them it will ask again. This one when you deny, you can't log in at all. Okay, I understand photo/media, if you can deposit checks from the app. Maybe call from app feature, I assume this is so you can call the help desk from the app, not necessary, but I understand. I draw the line at my location. There is no instance that I feel the bank needs to know my GPS location. Considering this is a feature I leave off on my phone unless I'm using Maps, I do not think it is okay for a bank to have unlimited access to turn it on as they wish.  CHANGE YOUR PERMISSIONS!!!
